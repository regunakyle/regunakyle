I am an aspiring fullstack developer in Hong Kong. I graduated from HKUST (*BSc* in Mathematics and Economics, minoring in IT) in 2020 :man_student:. Information Technology was not an industry I would see myself in, but after landing a job in a FinTech company I have fully embraced it. I enjoy the rapidly changing nature of this industry, being on the cutting edge of technology is awesome.

While I am not at work, I enjoy tinkering with my homelab. Having alternatives to popular services hosted in my own house gives me senses of privacy and accomplishment, and I learned a lot in the process of setting these up. I also like playing video games, particularly the most challenging ARPGs (e.g. Dark Souls series, Monster Hunter series). Hit me up if you need a buddy in Monster Hunter games! :crossed_swords::dragon:

I excel at Python (+Django) and SQL, have good experience in Java (+Spring Boot) and Javascript (+React). I also have much more knowledge of computer hardware and Linux server than your average developer :sunglasses:. I also have hand-on experience on DevOps (I set up the CI/CD environment in my company all by myself).

I also daily drive Linux (:tophat:[Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/) is my favourite distro!), with a Windows 10 virtual machine inside for [high-performance, low-latency gaming](../posts/002_win10_to_linux/). Find out more about my setup [here](https://github.com/regunakyle/dotfiles).

People working with me says I am a fast learner :scientist:, and they are not wrong: I enjoy doing research on topics I found interesting; I found a lot of topics in technology interesting ([Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/front) is my favourite source of tech news!).

As of now I am self-studying AWS management, system design and networking. Ideally I would see myself become a tech lead in a major company in the future.
