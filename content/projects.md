## Completed

### [LIHKG Gwent Guide](https://regunakyle.github.io/lihkg-gwent-guide/)

A guide for [GWENT: The Witcher Card Game](https://www.playgwent.com/) written with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

It has 1,000 visitors per month at it's peak. Unfortunately the game is [effectively discontinued](https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-red-is-sunsetting-support-for-gwent-the-witcher-card-game).

It is a fun game, and demands strategic planning rather than luck. I recommend you to try it.

### [My Discord Bot](https://github.com/regunakyle/my-discord-bot)

A Discord bot written in Python using [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Docker version available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/regunakyle/my-discord-bot).

It can send you notification about free game giveaways and also play Youtube music in voice chats :musical_note:.

There are plans to integrate a self-hosted :llama: *LLaMA* model with it, but I need to buy better hardware for my home server first.

## In Development

### VTuber Discovery Channel

A clone of [vtuber.hk](https://vtuber.hk/), the so-called *DD-site*. Written with React and Spring Boot.

The idea did not come from me: someone wanted to create their own *DD-site* because she thought the site was hostile to new VTubers, and her friend asked me for help.

Personally I do not watch VTubers, but I found the idea interesting enough for me to work on it. I will create a basic clone of *DD-site* first (with all of its functionality), then add more features like admin dashboard later.
